                        <h4>In The Beginning...</h4>
                        <p>The Odyssey has begun and I am on my way to becoming a web developer.
                        I have learned new terminology, theories, and practices for a career in the
                        tech industry. Growing up I used computers for personal and business purposes,
                        I played video games with friends, and I lived during the progression from dumb
                        phones to smart phones. All these experiences every day with tech and it still
                        was just magic to me how these products actually functioned. I am thrilled and
                        terrified to be starting this journey, but I will use the mantra to fail fast
                and fail forward!</p>
                        <h4>Git What???</h4>
                        <p>Pseudo code, pseudo code, pseudo code...The big push this week was
                        how to think about a project and an introduction to GitHub. Pseudo code
                        is great, and it is a must for any successful project. It is the process
                        of thinking through what is needed to solve a problem. It forces thought on
                        the full spectrum of a project from start to finish and creates a map
                        including thoughts about the users, the developers, the issues to overcome,
                        and what the end product will look like. It is a must thought process and a
                best practice for any programming endeavor.</p>
                        <p>GitHub was another new tool in the week's affairs. Git is a distributed
                        version control system and a powerful system for working on projects,
                        especially in a team environment. It allows for experimenting without
                        worrying about losing previous work. It also enables several people to
                        collaborate on different issues in a single project simultaneously. All
                        these abilities come with the severe warning that if not implemented correctly
                        then previous implementations can be overwritten or even lost. GitHub definitely
                has strong, “With great power, comes great responsibility” vibes!</p>
                        <h4>The Ubiquitous JavaScript</h4>
                        <p>I am starting to see how the network of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                        combine to create synergy in the web! Pseudo code again was a powerful
                        tool for the Silly Story Generator, and the newly introduced CodeWars
                        where we level up our abilities with Katas. CodeWars is a fun learning
                environment to target specific skills in a plethora of programming languages.</p>
                        <p>All the projects this week had a heavy JavaScript focus, and I am
                        building the fundamentals for the language. It is an Object Oriented
                        Programming (OOP) language. This means its power comes in creating generic
                        parts that can be recycled and reused across projects that may have nothing in
                        common in terms of purpose, but their parts can be interchanged. I am getting
                        the feeling that the curtain is being pulled back and the web is revealing
                        its secrets little by little. Next week is our last week of PreWork, and I am
                        looking forward to completing this phase and getting to the In-Person portion
                of the Awesome Inc U Bootcamp!</p>
                        <h4>Mobile, AGILE, Hostile!</h4>
                        <p>The last week of PreWork has come and gone and with each passing week,
                        it seems some understanding has come but more and more questions are inevitable.
                        In addition to diving deeper into JavaScript, the Agile Methodology was introduced.
                        It is a production environment with parts that sum greater than the whole. New
                        terminology like MoSCoW, Stories, Backlog, and much more were introduced. The Bootcamp
                        will take a deeper dive later in the process getting our hands dirty with this
                methodology but it seems to permeate throughout the industry.</p>
                        <p>Some new Katas and three projects were covered this week. It is a
                        challenge balancing all the work in a short amount of time, but the
                        instructors are great with their willingness to help and quick responses.
                        I am finding pseudocode is the best practice to start any project because it is
                so easy to get lost in what I am doing without a map to a finished product.</p>
                        <p>I am flying back from Denver on Sunday where I have spent the last two weeks and
                        very much looking forward to seeing people in the flesh who I have spent so much
                time with the past four weeks over Zoom. First phase complete and on to the next!</p>
