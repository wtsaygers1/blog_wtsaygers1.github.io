            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>I graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in Economics and minors in Spanish and Philosophy.
            Knowing I did not want a desk job, I joined Teach For America to pay forward all the support in my life. 
            I also had the opportunity to learn to fly and combining my passion for teaching, I earned several flight
            instructor certifications and helped others pursue their dreams of flight.</p>
            <p>I currently live in Lexington, KY as a web developer. I completed the Awesome Inc U Bootcamp gaining experience
            with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, PHP, Laravel, and MySQL. I love the nature of programming always
            in flux and progressing to advance computing power.</p>
            <p>I am exploring the vast possibilities in tech and relish the learning environment to grow professionally and
            personally. I am networking and meeting people from diverse backgrounds and unique paths to the tech industry.
            The experience of my transition to web development has been incredibly rewarding, and I want to ensure as I pursue
            my own path that I help others and pass my knowledge to the future generations!</p>
