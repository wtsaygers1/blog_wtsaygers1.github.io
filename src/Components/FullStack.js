                <h4>MVP...MVP...MVP... (Minimum Viable Product)</h4>
                <p>MVP in web development means something very different from any other 
                scenario where I have heard those three letters chanted together. A minimum 
                viable product or MVP is the bare minimum needed to complete the product. This
                week, I worked on creating a MVP for an already existing website. The process 
                was a valuable thinking exercise and challenged me to think what it means to be done. 
                I am incorporating everything I have learned so far to break down the atomic design 
                of a website’s frontend, architect a database of its back end, and implement the functionality 
                to connect the two.</p> 
                <p>Creating an MVP involves thinking about a problem from the point of view of a 
                product owner, a product manager, a developer, and a user. Drafting my MVP included 
                a MoSCoW, personas, stories, points, the tech stack, and what operating systems or 
                devices will host the product. It is an incredibly involved operation but provides a 
                route from start to finish and a guiding light for the order objectives need to be 
                completed. Next week will commence the final project and combine all the work from the 
                past 14 weeks.</p>
                <h4> One Project to Rule Them All</h4>
                <p>My final project is a social network for leisure sports like spikeball, pickleball, 
                and disc golf where people in the local community can post a profile and rank amongst 
                themselves. This project is a beast that implements all facets of a product’s life. It 
                was difficult to envision how to create my product and I am experiencing temptations to 
                change aspects all the time so I see why the MVP is so valuable in this regard. I know I 
                will struggle with designing my project because my main focus throughout this program has 
                been making projects function. I enjoy the back end and working with data so I will enjoy 
                working in the CRUD.</p> 
                <p>The experiences in the past couple weeks demonstrated the value of the Agile methodology. 
                I am currently working on small projects so while Agile is cumbersome to implement on something 
                that needs to be produced in a weeks’ time, I still enjoy getting practice with the method. The 
                benefits I see with a large scale project utilizing Agile are enormous. Collaborating on a team 
                and with separate departments need a strong organization system. Implementing a backlog with specific 
                stories that are appropriately made is critical to any project’s final success. Any functional 
                team would benefit from using Agile, and it is my favorite aspect that I learned about the tech 
                industry in this bootcamp!</p>
                <h4>Sprint, Sprint, Sprint</h4>
                <p>Gearing up for the last week and the final Demo Day has been a grind, and I have learned numerous 
                lessons during this time. The experience to develop an application from the ground up is difficult 
                and dirty and it requires discipline and determination. I have tremendous appreciation for estimating 
                how long it will take me to complete a story and creating stories in an appropriate manner. For anyone 
                unfamiliar with the term ‘Story’ in an Agile environment, it means a task that needs to be completed. 
                Stories are broken down into what is meant, definition of done, and how long it will take to reach that 
                definition of done. Once a story is complete, it is put into review and tested for any bugs. I enjoy 
                the testing process because </p>
